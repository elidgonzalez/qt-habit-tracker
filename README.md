**Software Requirements Document: Habit Tracker Application**
-------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Project Overview**

This document outlines the software requirements for a habit tracker
application designed for beginner developers using C++ and Qt. The
application will enable users to track their progress on various habits,
visualize their progress, and receive reminders.

**1.2 Target Audience**

This application is targeted towards individuals interested in learning
C++ and Qt development. It provides a practical project that
incorporates both programming and UI design fundamentals.

**2. Functional Requirements**

**2.1 Habit Management**

-   Users can add, edit, and delete habits.

-   Each habit should have a name, description, and optional category.

-   Users can set a frequency for each habit (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

**2.2 Progress Tracking**

-   Users can mark habits as completed for each day.

-   The application should keep track of cumulative progress for each habit.

-   Users can view their progress history and analyze trends.

**2.3 Data Visualization**

-   The application should provide visual representations of user progress, such as bar charts or calendars.

-   Users can customize the type of visualization and data range.

**2.4 Reminders**

-   Users can set reminders for upcoming habit tasks.

-   Reminders can be configured with different notification options (e.g., sound, pop-up message).

**2.5 Data Persistence**

-   The application should store user habits and progress data persistently.

-   Users should be able to export their data to a file for backup or analysis.

**3. Non-Functional Requirements**

**3.1 User Interface**

-   The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate for beginners.

-   The application should be visually appealing and adopt a modern design style.

-   The UI should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

**3.2 Performance**

-   The application should be responsive and performant even with large amounts of data.

-   Loading times should be minimized to ensure a smooth user experience.

**3.3 Reliability**

-   The application should be stable and free from crashes or errors.

-   Data should be stored securely and consistently.

**4. Software Interfaces**

The application will need to interface with the following software
components:

-   Qt libraries for UI development and functionality.

-   QChart library for data visualization.

-   SQLite database (optional) for storing user data persistently.

**5. Development Tools and Technologies**

-   C++ programming language

-   Qt framework and development tools

-   (Optional) IDE like Qt Creator

-   (Optional) SQLite database management tools

**6. Release Criteria**

-   The application should implement all functional requirements.

-   The UI should be visually appealing and user-friendly.

-   The application should be stable and free from critical errors.

-   The application should be documented with user manuals and technical specifications.

**7. Future Enhancements**

-   User authentication and account management.

-   Integration with calendar applications.

-   Social features like sharing progress with friends.

-   Implementation of advanced data visualization techniques.

-   Support for multi-platform deployment.
